# My First Playwright Project

Welcome! This repository contains my first end-to-end testing project using Playwright.

## What is Playwright?

[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is a powerful Node.js library that enables reliable end-to-end testing for modern web applications.  It's fast, reliable, and supports all major browsers (Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit).

In this project, I'm using Playwright to learn how to:

*  Automate browser interactions.
*  Write robust and maintainable end-to-end tests.
*  Verify the functionality of a web application.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to set up and run this project locally.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js:** Playwright requires Node.js. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).  It's recommended to use a recent LTS version or the latest stable version.
* **npm** or **Yarn:**  Node.js usually comes with npm (Node Package Manager).  Alternatively, you can use Yarn.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone playwright-first-project
   cd playwright-first-project
